# libraryManagement
Welcome Folks!!

I have created a library management system as a part of my DBMS paper project. It can be used in any library, all you have to to is update the database to which the program is connected to. 
For the backend(database) I've used MySql. You can keep the records of admins, books, students who issue books, along with everything all you have to do is make table for each of them.

The table you have to make are - 
##issuebooks
