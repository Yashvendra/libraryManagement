# libraryManagement
### Welcome Folks!!

I have created a library management system as a part of my DBMS project. It can be used in any library, all you have to to is update the database to which the program is connected to. 
For the backend (or database) I've used MySql. You can keep the records of admins, books, students who issue books, along with everything all you have to do is make table for each of them.

The table you have to make are - 


`issuebooks` - For the books issued by a student along with the date, time and his name.

`books` - Entry of each and every book in the library along with its status(available or not).

`librarian` - Maintained by the admin to add or remove librarians.


##### NOTE  
* Make sure that you enter all the details in the table and the number of columns should match the query you make inside the program.
